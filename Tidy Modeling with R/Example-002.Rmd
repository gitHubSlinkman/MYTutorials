# The Ames housing data

The Ames housing data set (De Cock 2011) is an excellent resource for learning about models that we will use throughout this book. It contains data on 2,930 properties in Ames, Iowa, including columns related to

    * house characteristics (bedrooms, garage, fireplace, pool, porch, etc.),
    * location (neighborhood),
    * lot information (zoning, shape, size, etc.),
    * ratings of condition and quality, and
    * sale price.
    
Our goal for these data is to predict the sale price of a house based on its other characteristics. 

Remark: Data sets like the Ames data set are used to appraise real estate. 

The raw data are provided by the authors, but in our analyses in this book, we use a transformed version available in the modeldata package. This version has several changes and improvements to the data7. For example, the longitude and latitude values have been determined for each property. Also, some columns were modified to be more analysis ready. For example:

The raw data are provided by the authors, but in our analyses in this book, we use a transformed version available in the ##modeldata## package. This version has several changes and improvements to the data7. For example, the longitude and latitude values have been determined for each property. Also, some columns were modified to be more analysis ready. For example:

* In the raw data, if a house did not have a particular feature, it was implicitly encoded as missing. For example, there were 2,732 properties that did not have an alleyway. Instead of leaving these as missing, they were relabeled in the transformed version to indicate that no alley was available.

* The categorical predictors were converted to R’s factor data type. While both the tidyverse and base R have moved away from importing data as factors by default, this data type is a better approach for storing qualitative data for modeling than simple strings.

* We removed a set of quality descriptors for each house since they are more like outcomes than predictors.

To  load the data we

```{r}
library(tidymodels)

data(ames)
dim(ames)
```

or we can load the data with one statement as follows:

```{r}
data(ames, package = "modeldata")

dim(ames)
```


## Exploring important features

It makes sense to start with the outcome we want to predict: the last sale price of the house (in USD).

Remark: I choose the fill color on the histogram to be green because the human eyes is most sensitive to this color.  I addition I add a density plot to this histogram.

```{r}
ggplot( ames,
        aes( x = Sale_Price, y = ..density.. )) +
            geom_histogram( bins = 50,
                            color = "black",
                            fill = "green" ) +
            geom_density() +
        theme_bw()
```

The data are right-skewed; there are more inexpensive houses than expensive ones. The median sale price was $160,000 and the most expensive house was $755,000. When modeling this outcome, a strong argument can be made that the price should be log-transformed. The advantages of doing this are that no houses would be predicted with negative sale prices and that errors in predicting expensive houses will not have an undue influence on the model. Also, from a statistical perspective, a logarithmic transform may also stabilize the variance in a way that makes inference more legitimate. Let’s visualize the transformed data:

```{r}
ggplot(ames, aes(x = Sale_Price, y=..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins  = 50,
                 color = "black",
                 fill  = "green") + 
  geom_density() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_bw()
```
While not perfect, this will probably result in better models than using the untransformed data.

Book author;s remarks: While not perfect, this will probably result in better models than using the untransformed data.

The units of the model coefficients might be more difficult to interpret, as will measures of performance. For example, the root mean squared error (RMSE) is a common performance metric that is used in regression models. It uses the difference between the observed and predicted values in its calculations. If the sale price is on the log scale, these differences (i.e. the residuals) are also in log units. For this reason, it can be difficult to understand the quality of a model whose RMSE is 0.15 log units.

Despite these drawbacks, the models used in this book utilize the log transformation for this outcome. From this point on, the outcome column is pre-logged in the ames data frame:

```{r}
ames <- 
    ames %>% 
        mutate(Sale_Price = log10(Sale_Price))

```

Another important aspect of these data for our modeling are their geographic locations. This spatial information is contained in the data in two ways: a qualitative Neighborhood label as well as quantitative longitude and latitude data. To visualize the spatial information, let’s use both together to plot the data on a map and color by neighborhood:
